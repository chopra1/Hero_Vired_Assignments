                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p class="desc">A photograph also known as a photo, image or picture is am image created by light falling on a
                    photosensitive surface, usvally photographic film or an elecctronic image sensor, such as a CCD or a CMOS
                    chip. Most photographs are now created using a smartphone camera which uses a lens to focus thescene's visible
                    wavelengrth of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating
                    such images is called photography.

                <h2>Videography</h2>
                <p class="desc">Videography is the process of capturing moving images on electric media (e.g. videotype,
                    direct to disk recording or solid state storage) and even streaming media. The term includesmethod
                    of video production and post-production. It used to be considered the video equivalent to the cinematography
                    (moving image recorded on film stock) but the advent of digital video recording in the late 20th century
                    blurred the distinction between the two, as in both methods the intermediary mechanism between the same.
                    nowadays, any video work could be called videography whereas commercial motion picture production would be called cinematography.
